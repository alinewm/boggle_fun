# THE ULTIMATE BOGGLE GAME

This is a boggle implementation as a Python desktop game done for funzies. I was really intrigued about the use of Tries in word games, and I love word games, so I thought this was the perfect opportunity to merge both interests together. This is my first game ever, so excuse me if the code isn't the neatest.

So the way boggle works is it first starts with the main page.
It has a button named play.
Once you press that button, you get a screen with a 4x4 square with 16 mini-squares, a text field, and an empty space below where your entries will be listed, and a counter of the number of words you've gotten.
Each mini-square has a randomly generated letter.
Your goal as the player is to write down as many valid and unique english words as possible in the text box.
If you enter an invalid word that had already been entered or doesn't exist, it will appear crossed off the text field and won't count.
